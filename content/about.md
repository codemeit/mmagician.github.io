# About

I currently work as a Technical Evaluator at the Web3 Foundation, evaluating [Grants](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program).

As a side project, I'm working on [the Zero Knowledge Sudoku Game](/smoothie) and running a few [validator nodes](/validator).

When I'm not coding, I'm probably out doing some sports.
