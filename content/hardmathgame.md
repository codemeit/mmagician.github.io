# Hard Math Game

(and no, I don't need a new name)

## Story

When I was a teenager, I remember our math teacher would show us a game at the end of the class if we had extra time. He would project a series of slides onto a screen. On each slide, there were four squares, each with an integer on it. The goal of the game was coming up with a sequence of operations (only addition and multiplication were allowed) that would use all the four numbers and arrive at 24. 

This was sometime around 2008-10. Fast forward a few years - I learned to code and was especially familiar with Java, since that's what they taught us at uni. I always remembered that game from high school (maybe 'coz I was usually top of the class?). Towards the end of 2016 I started writing a mobile version of the game, which would become Hard Math Game - I never remembered the name of the original, and I kinda liked this **creative** name. This was a part-time effort, a side project, and so took me a while to get things released.

Finally, after quitting a job I found time to polish it off and run extensive UX testing with *real users* (sorry friends and random people on the plane for being annoying), and released in November 2018.

## Choice of tech stack

When I started building the game, frameworks such as React Native weren't very mature and the only cross-platform options out there were frameworks like Apache Cordova, which suffered from bad preformance, and, to be honest, had **horrible** interface. 

On top of that, I was already fairly proficient with Java, so unfortunately you can only get my game on an Android device.
